# Tables

This section shows tables rendered with Nefertiti for Sphinx.

Unlike other components, tables written in Markdown are different from those written in reStructuredText. When using the Markdown standard syntax cells can be aligned but can not span other cells, while when using reStructuredText standard syntax cells can not be aligned but can span other cells.

This section is separated in two documents, one written in Markdown and another written in reStructuredText to show the standard syntax for tables in each language.

When a table is wider than the width of the central column Nefertiti adds a small expand icon at the top right side of the table that allows to open the table in a modal window.

```{toctree}
:glob:
tables-md.md
tables-rst.rst
```
