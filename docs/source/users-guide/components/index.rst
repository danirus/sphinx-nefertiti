The following pages contain examples of visual elements that can be included in Sphinx docs. The goals of this section are:

* To show how these elements look like when using Nefertiti for Sphinx,
* to help with the development of the theme itself, and
* to serve as a reminder of how to include these elements in reStructuredText and Markdown documents.

The sphinx-themes.org project collects and tests many Sphinx themes with an extensive set of markup elements. Visit the section dedicated to `Nefertiti for Sphinx <https://sphinx-themes.org/sample-sites/sphinx-nefertiti/>`_ to see how the theme renders the testing documentation of sphinx-themes.org.
