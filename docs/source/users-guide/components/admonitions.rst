Admonitions
###########

A Sphinx admonition consist of three elements:

* the type of the admonition,
* An optional title, and
* the body, which is normally text.

Sphinx supports the following types of admonitions: **attention**, **caution**, **danger**, **error**, **hint**, **important**, **note**, **tip**, **warning**.

Admonitions are written like this in reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. type::

        Text of the admonition

Or like this in Markdown:

.. code-block:: markdown

    :::{type}
    Notes can provide complementary information.
    :::

Be aware that Markdown examples in this page are using ``"colon_fence"``. Read about it `here <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html#code-fences-using-colons>`_.

In both cases replace the ``type`` with any of the possible type of admonitions: **admonition** (for custom admonitions with title), **attention**, **caution**, **danger**, **error**, **hint**, **important**, **note**, **tip** and **warning**.
