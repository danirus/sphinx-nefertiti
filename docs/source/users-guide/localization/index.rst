Localization
############

The interface provided by Nefertiti for Sphinx is available in two languages, English and Spanish. Translating the catalog of messages to another language is an easy and fast task as the catalog is not long.

The following sections explain how to localize your Sphinx site with Nefertiti. If the language you want to use is other than English or Spanish, please consider sending a Pull Request to include it in the next release of Nefertiti for Sphinx.

Single or multilingual sites
****************************

This part of the documentation explains how to use Nefertiti in a language other than English, or in a multilingual site.
