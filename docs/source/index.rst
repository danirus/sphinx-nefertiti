Nefertiti for Sphinx
====================

Nefertiti for Sphinx is a customizable theme for `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.

The name is taken from the figure of Nefertiti, the queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti>`_). Women in ancient Egypt had more rights than many women living in the present day (`World History Encyclopedia <https://www.worldhistory.org/article/623/women-in-ancient-egypt/>`_).

This documentation explains how to make use of the Nefertiti theme with Sphinx projects.
