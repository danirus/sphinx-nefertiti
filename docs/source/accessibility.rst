Nefertiti for Sphinx is built with the goal to provide the maximum accessibility.

The static site built with the Nefertiti for Sphinx theme can be browsed using only the keyboard. All the elements with their ARIA attributes, and all the color combinations and color sets, have been verified with the `Accessibility Insights for Web <https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/reference/help/>`_ browser extension.

The code of Nefertiti for Sphinx is an ongoing effort, it may contain errors or lack of support using certain devices or technologies.

If you become aware of any accessibility problem when using this theme, please, report an issue in GitHub and add the label ``accessibility``. When reporting an accessibility issue try to share as much information as possible about the particular scenario in which the issue happens, including the Operating System, the device, and the reading technology it uses.

This project is maintained without any warranty under the MIT License, but it is in the spirit of their developers to maintain it as accessible as possible.
