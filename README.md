## Index filtering

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="315" height="417" src="https://github.com/danirus/sphinx-nefertiti/blob/main/docs/source/_static/img/index-filtering-1.png"></p>

By default the **index** shows the content folded. Opening or closing items is remembered while browsing the documentation. To quickly find items use the input filter. The filter will display items that could be invisible within a folded item. When the user types in the input field, let us say `fo`, the index gets filtered with all the entries that match those two characters. So the index will display three matches: `Fonts`, `Footer links` and `Footnotes`. Those three entries were all folded within their sections:

##  The TOC on the right side

The Table of Contents, displayed on the right side, spans itself to the right border of the browser to display long items, improving readability.

## To develop it

Clone the Git repository, create a Python virtual environment, and install the NodeJS packages:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:danirus/sphinx-nefertiti.git
cd sphinx-nefertiti
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
nvm use --lts
npm install
```

Before contributing, please, install the pre-commit hook scripts:
